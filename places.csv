p1,University Hall,"University Hall was built in three phases beginning in 1770 with funding from money gathered by Brown University’s Corporation\, the University’s main governing body. The building was the first and only of Brown University\, which was founded in 1764\, for the first fifty years of the college’s existence. As the sole building on Brown’s campus\, University Hall housed students\, administrative offices, and classes. In 1823\, University Hall gained its current name\, having previously been named the “College Edifice.” As of 2015\, it holds the offices of the University’s President\, Director of Admissions\, and other administrative offices.
Workers who helped to build the building were supplied with rum and sugar during construction. Similar to many buildings on Brown’s campus\, University Hall was built at least in part by slave labor. Brown University co-founder John Brown owned slaves\, and Brown\, his family\, and the university were direct benefactors from the Trans-Atlantic slave trade that took millions of West Africans and Caribbean people from their homes and forced them into hard labor without pay. Though Brown University co-founder and John’s brother\, Quaker Moses Brown, made it a point to not own slaves in his own life\, Brown University was a direct benefactor from the slave trade. A point of this was established as a visual part of Brown’s history in 2014\, as a Slavery Memorial was put on what is known as the “Quiet Green” on the Prospect Street side of University Hall to acknowledge Brown’s complicity in the incredibly violent system of slavery\, and to remember those who have been forgotten or erased by the trade and its memory.",uhall.jpg,41.826075,-71.403901
p2,Sharpe-Refectory,"The Sharpe-Refectory\, or “The Ratty\,” as it is currently more commonly known\, was opened in 1951, and was named after Chancellor Henry D. Sharpe. Sharpe was a Brown graduate of the class of 1895 who became president of the university five years after his graduation. He continued to work at Brown as a fifty-year member of the Corporation\, as a university trustee\, and as a financial supporter of five fellowships in various university departments. Initially\, the dining hall was intended to serve 1,640 students\, and contained 18 private dining halls\, one for each of the campus’ 17 fraternities\, and one more. The practice of having these rooms be private was changed in 1982. The food service in the Ratty has changed over time as well. Initially students worked at the dining hall and served their fellow students by delivering large plates of food to tables. Students at the tables would then serve what they liked to themselves while remaining at the large table. Currently\, the Ratty serves food in an all-you-can-eat cafeteria style in which students gather their own food from lines.",ratty.jpg,41.825118,-71.400815
p3,Slater,"Slater Hall was built in 1879 with funding from Horatio Nelson Slater. Slater offered the money on the condition that the next president of Brown would be Ezekiel Gilman Robinson. Slater has served\, and currently serves as a residential space for students on the Main Green of Brown’s campus. It is one of two residential spaces for students on the Main Green\, the other being Hope College.",slater.jpg,41.825783,-71.403866
p4,Faunce,"Faunce House was built in1904 and was formerly named Rockefeller House after John D. Rockefeller who provided substantial funds for the buildings establishment. The building was intended to be under the auspices of the Brown University Corporation, but to be run by Brown’s chapter of the Young Men’s Christian Association (Y.M.C.A.). The building originally contained space for students to smoke, have their hair cut, and play pool. Future expansions of the building, such as the one announced in 1930 with a $600,000 donation by John D. Rockefeller, included spaces for the college’s bookstore, dining halls, and a theatre. The theatre, which by the 1980s housed the Brown student theatre group Production Workshop, was removed, and Production Workshop moved to its current location at T.F. Green. The former theatre space on the second floor has since been converted to a study space known as the Leung Gallery. The current Faunce House also houses the Blue Room dining establishment, the Petteruti Lounge meeting space, pool tables, a Campus Market for the purchase of snacks and food, and student support offices such as the Curricular Resource Center.",faunce.jpg,41.82685,-71.403253
p5,Barus & Holley,"Barus & Holley is the university’s home for the Engineering Department. The construction of Barus & Holley raised a lot of controversy among Providence’s East Side residents as property owners expressed concerns about the blocking off of Manning Street that was proposed for the building’s construction\, and about the potential decrease in property values owing to the height of the proposed building. The building was ultimately established in 1965.",bh.jpg,41.82658,-71.397972
